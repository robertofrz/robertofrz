Hi there! I'm Roberto
I'm a frontend developer passionate about building modern, accessible, and user-friendly web interfaces. I focus on creating digital experiences that are not only visually appealing but also performant and maintainable.

I primarily work with the React ecosystem and modern frontend tools. I enjoy diving deep into how and why technologies work, always aiming to write cleaner, scalable, and more thoughtful code.

Here on my GitHub, youâ€™ll find some of the projects Iâ€™ve built, whether to learn something new, test ideas, or solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m always open to exchanging ideas, collaborating, and tackling exciting challenges together.

Letâ€™s connect! ðŸ˜„
