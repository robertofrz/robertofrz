Hello world! I’m Roberto, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I have a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with experience in data handling using Web APIs such as Fetch, the DOM, and localStorage. I’m also proficient in Git/GitHub, Webpack for efficient module bundling, and Jest for unit testing, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code. Familiar with React and actively studying to strengthen my skills. I’m always eager to understand not just the ‘how’ but also the ‘why’ behind the tools and methodologies I use.

Let’s connect! I’m open to exchanging ideas, learning, and collaborating on exciting projects!
