Hello world! I’m Roberto, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I have experience with JavaScript, React, and modern tools like Vite for fast project builds. I work with React Query for efficient state management and data fetching, utilizing REST APIs with fetch and Axios. I also have knowledge of Vitest for testing, along with CSS and HTML to create responsive and engaging interfaces. Additionally, I use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. I’m always eager to understand not just the ‘how’ but also the ‘why’ behind the tools and methodologies I use.

Let’s connect! I’m open to exchanging ideas, learning, and collaborating on exciting projects!
