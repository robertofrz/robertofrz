Hi, I'm Roberto, I'm Brazilian, I'm 30 years old and I currently live in São Paulo city. I'm a self-taught professional in the field of web development, always motivated by curiosity and the desire to learn something new every day. With an ease in acquiring and applying new knowledge, I dedicate myself to technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git/GitHub, in addition to exploring areas such as UX/UI, web animations and responsive design. I believe in continuous learning and strive to understand not only the "how" but also the "why" behind the tools and methodologies I use.
